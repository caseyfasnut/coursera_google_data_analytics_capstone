# Google Data Analytics Course Capstone Project

Greetings, this repository showcases the capstone project I completed for the Google Data Analytics course available through Coursera.  

I started the course near the end of February and I was able to complete the final project on April 29, 2021.  

Prior to starting the course I had ZERO experience with SQL, R, Google Cloud Platform, or BigQuery.  Now that I have finished I am able to use SQL and R to clean, manipulate, and visualize data.  I really enjoyed the course, particularly the SQL and R portions.  So much so that I found myself practicing, watching videos, and leaarning as much about SQL and R as I could when I wasn't doing the coursework.  Fortunatley the course uses SQL throughout and you will gets a lot of opprotunities to develop those skills.  R is limited to one of the 8 sections near the end of the course.  I would reccommend starting R on your own TODAY, if you wait until the course introduces it, you will be waiting a while.  I found R to be the most exciting and after seeing R I have started doing almost everything in R.
