# Google Data Analytics Course Capstone Project

Greetings, this repository showcases the capstone project I completed for the Google Data Analytics course available through Coursera.  

I started the course near the end of February and I was able to complete the final project on April 29, 2021.  

Prior to starting the course I had ZERO experience with SQL, R, Google Cloud Platform, or BigQuery.  Now that I have finished I am able to use SQL and R to clean, manipulate, and visualize data.  I really enjoyed the course, particularly the SQL and R portions.  So much so that I found myself practicing, watching videos, and leaarning as much about SQL and R as I could when I wasn't doing the coursework.  Fortunatley the course uses SQL throughout and you will gets a lot of opprotunities to develop those skills.  R is limited to one of the 8 sections near the end of the course.  I would reccommend starting R on your own TODAY, if you wait until the course introduces it, you will be waiting a while.  I found R to be the most exciting and after seeing R I have started doing almost everything in R.

## The Case Study

The scenario for this case study: You are a data analyst working for Bellabeats (a fitness/health/wellness smart device manufacturer that focuses on Women's health.  You are given a dataset that contains various tables of FitBit user data (33 users over 31 days). You are asked to analyze this data to look at trends in usage and determine potential areas for growth.  Ultimatley you will make high level reccommendations supported with visuals.  

## Technologies

While I would have naturally done all of this in R.  I had applied to a job where SQL was a 'nice to have'.  So expecting an imminent interview I decided to showcase some SQL queries.  I also decided to make the vizualiztions with Tableau because it seemed like there would be a high probability the company I applied to work at is utiliziing Tableau.  

The tables I chose to use did not exceed 1k rows of observations and was easily handled with Excel and later with BigQuery.  

## Input

Thank you for looking at my first data analysis project, if you have **ANY** suggestions or critics **PLEASE** feel free to send them my way. 

Cheers,
